## Faculty Updates 

I can say with certainty---which is **rare** in our discipline---that the 2020--2021 academic year was the most difficult for the faculty in...who knows how long? 
We all adapted our pedagogy to remote instruction and settled in for the long haul of a year of Zoom meetings and online classes. 
My heart goes out to **Sara Stoudt '15**, who accepted a one-year teaching position and then never got to set foot in her office or in a Smith classroom!

It was nevertheless an eventful year for faculty:

- **Miles Ott '01** was granted tenure and promotion to associate professor in February. To our great sadness, Miles resigned his position at the end of the year to become a Chief Data Scientist at Johnson & Johnson. We wish Miles all the best in his new line of work and will miss him dearly. 
- **Sara Stoudt '15** accepted [a tenure-track position at Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/fac-staff/sara-stoudt). We're thrilled for Sara and look forward to collaborating with her. 
- We hired **Lindsay Poirier** as a MassMutual assistant professor of statistics and data science. Lindsay is a data anthropologist who comes to us from [UC-Davis](https://lindsaypoirier.faculty.ucdavis.edu/). We're super-excited about the breadth of new course offerings she will offer and the experience she brings to the Program. 
- We hired **Fatou Sanogo** as a Lecturer. [Fatou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fatoumata-sanogo-447085a8/) just completed her PhD in applied mathematics at the University of Alabama-Birmingham. She'll be teaching mostly introductory statistics and we are lucky to have her here as she starts her career. 
- We'll be searching for **three** tenure-track positions this year!
    - a biostatistician
    - a 2nd MassMutual assistant professor position
    - a joint position to be shared with the Mathematics department for a Mathematical Statistician

It was a hard year to be Chair! 
We never even had the chance to celebrate my tenure decision before the pandemic threw us all into a tailspin. 
I'm grateful to my family and my colleagues for their perseverance through all the challenges we faced. 

We finished the [2nd edition of *Modern Data Science with R*](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/). 
There are some interesting things starting to come out of the [DSC-WAV project](https://dsc-wav.github.io/www/outreach.html), which now entering its 3rd year. 
In particular, we've been tracking how some of the software development practices (e.g., GitHub and Scrum) we've been implementing with students have fared in the remote working environment. 

I continue to be in awe of the resilience of Smithies (and their general fabulous-ness)!

With both teaching and conferences all virtual, this year was like no other for sure! In the spring, I taught two different machine learning classes: _Modeling for Machine Learning_ (SDS 293) and _Computational Machine Learning_ (CSC 294). 
It was great to [gather](https://gather.town/) and work through the details of various Machine Learning concepts. 

Since last newsletter, I once again was a co-organizer for the [Women In Music Information Retrieval Workshop](https://wimir.wordpress.com/2020/08/13/wimir-workshop-2020-project-guides/) and for the [Machine Learning for Media Discovery Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/ml4md2020/home). 
I had a lot of fun working with collaborators this year. 
[Automatic Hierarchy Expansion for Improved Structure and Chord Evaluation](https://transactions.ismir.net/articles/10.5334/tismir.71/) with [Brian McFee](https://brianmcfee.net/) expands on our ISMIR 2019 paper. 
It was also fun to integrate my interests in MIR and pedagogy in [Interactive Learning of Signal Processing Through Music: Making Fourier Analysis Concrete for Students](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9418542) with [Meinard Mueller](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/mueller) and Brian McFee. 
This summer, I've been privileged to work with five students through the SURF program, which is a great way to wrap up this year of virtual collaboration

## Alumni Updates

- [Anna Ballou '20](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-ballou/): I just finished my first year of my PhD in Quantitative Epidemiology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  I am studying the sex-specific effects of the genetic architecture of various diseases. I've also worked on generating several graphics and figures for my lab's publications. 

- [Brittany Bennett '16](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thebbennett/): is on her second year of serving as the Data Director of the Sunrise Movement. She leverages analytics engineering to uncover insight for organizers working to pass a Green New Deal. [You can follow her writing here](https://www.brittanybennett.com/blog)


## What's next? 

### Joint Statistical Meetings

Many of us will be at the virtual Joint Statistical Meetings at the end of the month. We wish we could see you in person, but we'll have to settle for Zoom waves this year. `r emo::ji("disappointed")`

### StatFest


### Women in Statistics and Data Science Conference
