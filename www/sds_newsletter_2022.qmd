## Faculty Updates 

- [Fatou Sanogo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fatoumata-sanogo-447085a8/) got a tenure-track job at Bates! We're wishing Fatou all the best in her next steps. 
- We hired **Kaitlyn Cook** as a tenure-track faculty member. [Kaitlyn](https://www.populationmedicine.org/kcook) is a biostatistician coming from the Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed her doctorate and a postdoc. Her research focuses on methodological development for cluster-correlated and interval-censored data, with a particular emphasis on applications to cluster-randomized HIV (or other infectious disease) prevention studies. 
- We hired **Shiya Cao** as a MassMutual assistant professor of statistical and data sciences. 
Shiya comes to us from WPI, where she completed her PhD in Information Technology. Her research focuses on [disability inclusion and broader social inclusion topics](https://www.shiyacao.com/). 
- We hired **Jared Joseph** as a Lecturer for the next two years. [Jared](https://jnjoseph.com/) just completed his PhD in sociology at UC-Davis. His research uses computational techniques and civic data to uncover patterns of behavior that are otherwise unseen. For example, political networks of prohibition gangsters and bias hidden in the text of academic recruitment.
- We'll be searching for **two** tenure-track positions this year, both of which are joint with other departments!
    - a joint position with the Mathematical Sciences department for a mathematical statistician  
    - a joint position with the Physics department for a computational physicist
