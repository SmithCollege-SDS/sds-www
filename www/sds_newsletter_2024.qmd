Hola, buenas días!

I'm glad to be back in Northampton after spending my full-year sabbatical in Medellín, Colombia!
It was an amazing experience from which we all learned a great deal. 
My wife and I took many Spanish classes at [Universidad EAFIT](https://www.eafit.edu.co/), which is a lovely place to study. 
We advanced to B2 level Spanish in the [CEFR framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages). 
I suppose it's bittersweet to report that our daughters are both: 1) much better Spanish-speakers than we are; and 2) so much better that they are horrified by our attempts to speak Spanish! 

While on sabbatical I was able to complete the [3rd edition of *Analyzing Baseball Data with R*](https://beanumber.github.io/abdwr3e/), and I struck up a new collaboration with a statistician that I met at EAFIT. 
We're working on [an R package](https://github.com/beanumber/tidychangepoint/) and [a paper](https://beanumber.github.io/changepoint-paper/) for changepoint detection algorithms.
