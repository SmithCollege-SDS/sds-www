Hola, buenas días!

I'm glad to be back in Northampton after spending my full-year sabbatical in Medellín, Colombia!
It was an amazing experience from which we all learned a great deal. 
My wife and I took many Spanish classes at [Universidad EAFIT](https://www.eafit.edu.co/), which is a lovely place to study. 
We advanced to B2 level Spanish in the [CEFR framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages). 
I suppose it's bittersweet to report that our daughters are both: 1) much better Spanish-speakers than we are; and 2) so much better that they are horrified by our attempts to speak Spanish! 

While on sabbatical I was able to complete the [3rd edition of *Analyzing Baseball Data with R*](https://beanumber.github.io/abdwr3e/), and I struck up a new collaboration with a statistician that I met at EAFIT. 
We're working on [an R package](https://github.com/beanumber/tidychangepoint/) and [a paper](https://beanumber.github.io/changepoint-paper/) for changepoint detection algorithms.

The last year has been one of many big and exciting changes! Last August, I got married and we went on our honeymoon to Curacao over winter break. I was on sabbatical in the Spring Semester, and we bought a house in Holyoke. I am looking forward to hitting the ground running this Fall and I'm excited to be back.

My sabbatical was spent wrapping up some existing research projects, and also planning out the next few years of my work with students. [My State Politics Lab](https://www.smith.edu/academics/our-approach-learning/humanities#state-politics-lab-8) has done a tremendous amount of working helping me build a comprehensive database of LGBTQ policies in the American States, and I took a team of Smithies to Chicago for the Midwest Political Science Association Conference to present our work in April. We are continuing our work this Fall by using text analysis to track the influence of interest groups in states passing Gender Affirming Care Bans and Conversion Therapy Bans. 

This upcoming year, I will be teaching my *Research Seminar in Political Networks* (SDS/GOV 338) in the Fall, and plan on teaching *Research Design and Analysis* (SDS 290) and *Introduction to American Politics* (GOV 200) in the Spring.

Hello SDS friends! For me, this has been year of building new connections and finding new forms of balance. A Spring sabbatical provided me time to really submerge into aspects of my research program. This past February I spent a month in Frankfurt, Germany on a Mercator Fellowship at Goethe University. While I was there, I delivered a number of lectures and workshops and had a chance to work with faculty, post-docs, and graduate students brainstorming how to devise new ethnographic methods for studying the cultural aspects of data production, circulation, and use. Then in March, with some tremendous collaborators at UCLA, Northeastern University, and Whitman College, I published a paper documenting that almost half of US carceral facilities are proximate to sites of contamination by "forever chemicals" (or PFAS). The paper was covered in *[The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/4547224-forever-chemicals-pfas-us-prisons-drinking-water-dangerous-levels-study/)*, *[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/08/prisons-contaminated-water-pfas)*, and supported the development of [proposed legislation](https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-rep-pressley-introduce-environmental-health-in-prisons-act) for improving environmental health in prisons. Publishing this paper meant a lot to me, both personally and professionally. Sabbatical also granted me some time for more personal pursuits. I've been working on my French, devising Massachusetts adventures for me and my 2.5-year old niece, and putting some elbow grease into making my new house in South Hadley feel more like a home. 

This coming year, I'm looking forward to continuing my research examining the cultural origins of the [Open Payments](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/) database - anthropologically studying how the professionals responsible for disclosing data about their payments to healthcare providers develop certain accounting and meaning-making strategies in their work. I look forward to continue teaching *Data Ethnography* (SDS 237) in the Fall and Spring, and to offering a new course called *Community-Based Data Science* (SDS) in the Spring.
