## Faculty Updates 

- [**Albert Kim** was promoted](https://www.smith.edu/news/faculty-2023-tenure-and-promotions) to associate professor with tenure! **Ben Baumer** was also promoted to full Professor. 
- We hired [**Casey Berger**](https://www.caseyeberger.com/) to a joint tenure-track position with the Physics department. Casey has been teaching at Smith already and her research is in applying high performance computing and machine learning methods to many-body quantum systems. She has already designed a new course, SDS 271, which she will offer in the fall as a Python-based alternative to SDS 270. Casey was just recently elected as a Member-At-Large for the Topical Group in Data Science within the American Physics Society. We're super-excited to keep her at Smith!
- We also hired **Rebecca Kurtz-Garcia** into a joint tenure-track position with the Mathematical Sciences department. Rebecca comes to us from the University of California, Riverside, where she recently completed her Ph.D. in statistics. Rebecca works in the intersection of time series analysis, econometrics, spectral analysis, and steady state simulation. She is starting as a Project NExT fellow this summer, and will be teaching introductory statistics and mathematical statistics in her first year. Yay!
- After completing his first year, **Jared Joseph** is moving on to pursue a permanent job in the criminal investigations unit of the Internal Revenue Service. We're sad to see Jared go, but excited to see what he does next!

I am about to embark on what I can only hope will be a fantastic adventure during the full-year sabbatical I'm now starting: my family and I will spend the year in Medellín, Colombia! 
I will have an appointment as a Visiting Faculty member at the [Universidad EAFIT](https://www.eafit.edu.co/), and I am also anticipating extending my current role as interim Editor-in-Chief of the [*Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports*](https://www.degruyter.com/journal/key/jqas/html?lang=en) for a three-year term. 
Learning a new language in your forties hasn't been easy, but I took SPN 200 at Smith this spring with Prof. Adrián Gras-Velazquez and learned a lot while making some new friends. 

Cuando vuelvo hablaremos español juntos!

Year three at Smith was my favorite so far, and I've really enjoyed seeing all the traditions come back in full force! The past year has been full of collaborations with students, and I had my first opportunity to take Smithies with me to the Midwest Political Science Association Conference.

This past Spring, I was able to start up the State Politics Lab through the Humanities and Social Science Lab program on campus. This lab focuses on tracking state legislatures across the American states to see what policy networks are forming. In particular, we are currently tracking laws around LGBT topics and are looking to collaborate with journalists and activists to get a better understanding of why some states pass restrictions and others do not. We are in the middle of data collection right now, but plan on starting to analyze the data this Fall and present our work. This research lies at the intersection of Government and Data Science, so please reach out if you are interested in joining our team this Fall. My reserach is continuing to focus on how public opinion is translated into policy across the states, and using network analysis to study how states are influenicng each other. 

This upcoming year, I will be teaching *Introduction to Probability and Statistics* (SDS 220) in the Fall, as well as *The Politics of Public Policy* (GOV 207) for the Government department.  I will be on sabbatical in the Spring, but will be around campus.
