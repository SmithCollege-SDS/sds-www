## Faculty Updates 

- [**Albert Kim** was promoted](https://www.smith.edu/news/2023-tenure-and-promotion) to associate professor with tenure!
- We hired [**Casey Berger**](https://www.caseyeberger.com/) to a joint tenure-track position with the Physics department. Casey has been teaching at Smith already and her research is in applying high performance computing and machine learning methods to many-body quantum systems. She has already designed a new course, SDS 271, which she will offer in the fall as a Python-based alternative to SDS 270. Casey was just recently elected as a Member-At-Large for the Topical Group in Data Science within the American Physics Society. We're super-excited to keep her at Smith!
- We also hired **Rebecca Kurtz-Garcia** into a joint tenure-track position with the Mathematical Sciences department. Rebecca comes to us from the University of California, Riverside, where she recently completed her Ph.D. in statistics. She is starting as a Project NExT fellow this summer, and will be teaching introductory statistics and mathematical statistics in her first year. Yay!
- We'll be searching for **two** tenure-track positions this year, both of which are joint with other departments!
    - a joint position with the Mathematical Sciences department for a mathematical statistician  
    - a joint position with the Physics department for a computational physicist
