## Faculty Updates 

#### Ben Baumer

I'm trying to enjoy all the time at home with my wife and two children. `r emo::ji("zany")` Alice is 6, and she can now read, swim, ride a bike, and log in to a Linux terminal. Arlo is 3 and she is an adorable terror. Today I woke up when she jumped on my head (true story). 

Last fall, I taught a new course on advanced programming with R, that was very rewarding for both the students and me. [They wrote 11 R packages in three weeks](https://twitter.com/BaumerBen/status/1220456055353892864), some of which have already built up a user base and may make it onto CRAN! 

I'm now a *tenured* associate professor, which is strange and wonderful. I'm working on finishing a 2nd edition of our data science textbook, *Modern Data Science with R*. This one will have [a free online version](https://beanumber.github.io/mdsr2e/)! This is been a very trying year, but I'm so encouraged by all the incredible work our alums are doing and all the fabulous colleagues I get to work with!

This crazy year is divided in half by COVID-19! One highlight for me from the before times is that I took five Smith students to the Women in Statistics and Data Science's annual conference held this year in Bellevue Washington. Our flight out of Bradley was cancelled due to a [plane crash](https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2019/10/02/vintage-aircraft-crashes-at-bradley-international-airport-connecticut.cnn), so we changed our flights to Logan. We then left a wallet in the Valley Transporter van upon arrival at Logan (but got it back!) and then we left a laptop at TSA in route to our gate (but got it back later!). In the end we [MADE it](https://twitter.com/randiLgarcia/status/1179600080829128704)! It was a joy to speak on the plenary panel, "Creating and Sustaining Respectful and Inclusive Community" and to attend my first WSDS! In the Fall semester I also taught my research seminar PSY 364: Research seminar in Intergroup Relationships for the second time, and SDS 291: Multiple Regression for the first time. It was lovely! During COVID times I've picked up several hobbies including gardening, cooking, meditation, reading for pleasure and personal growth, and *beginner* guitar. This year I've published papers in the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology and Frontiers in Psychology's section on Gender, Sex and Sexualities. I've also recently submitted a paper investigating daily instagram use and women's self-objectification for publication in a psychology journal.

#### Scott LaCombe

[Scott LaCombe](https://scottlacombe.weebly.com/) is joining Smith College this Fall with a joint appointment in Statistical and Data Sciences and Government. He received his PhD in Political Science from the University of Iowa and will be living in New England for the first time. Scott's focus is leveraging data to better understand how public opinion is translated into state policies, and what networks states have formed when developing policy solutions. He is very excited to be teaching in the Fall and exploring the Pioneer Valley.

- [Brittany Bennett '16](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thebbennett/): I am bending the laws of mathematics to engineer the backend infrastructure, analyze the data, and establish the systems needed to turn out the youth vote in key swing states in November and pass bold climate legislation in the new year.
