<h1 class="title toc-ignore">SDS Newsletter</h1>
<h4 class="author">Ben Baumer</h4>
<h4 class="date">July 15, 2020</h4>

</div>


<p>How can you even begin to summarize the year since our last newsletter? So much has changed, and so much of it is has not been for the better. Like everyone else, we are struggling through the global COVID-19 pandemic (still). We are fighting for racial justice, asking ourselves tough questions about privilege, racism, and white supremacy, and making moves towards a more just future (still). Among the year’s many highlights, perhaps the most enduring will be the successful effort by <strong>Miles Ott ’01</strong> <a href="https://www.change.org/p/american-statistical-association-rename-the-fisher-lecture-after-david-blackwell">to petition</a> the ASA to rename the Fisher Award (one of the most prestigious in all of statistics). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher">R.A. Fisher</a> was a virulent eugenicist, but thanks in part to Miles’s leadership, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COPSS_Distinguished_Achievement_Award_and_Lectureship#Renaming_of_the_lectureship">his award has been officially retired</a>.</p>
<p>This newsletter is mostly a distillation of our Twitter @<a href="https://twitter.com/SmithCollegeSDS">SmithCollegeSDS</a> feed. Please follow us to see more news, updates, and pictures!</p>
<p>There is also a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/665780273559948/">Facebook group</a>, a Google group, and a <a href="https://twitter.com/Miles_Ott/status/1242104426921426945">Slack</a>. <strong>Please help us reach out to other alumnae by having them contact me!</strong></p>

<h2>Program Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The graduates of 2020 were (temporarily) deprived of the typical rituals, but <a href="https://twitter.com/livin_emma/status/1262086475035938817">they celebrated anyway</a>. The program had 42 graduates this year, which is (of course) another new record. This group was extraordinary. Just some of their accomplishments are listed below, but there are (and will be) many, many more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Randi Garcia</strong> accepted her Sherrerd Award for Distinguished Teaching.</p></li>

<h2>Faculty Updates</h2>
<p>Some big changes occurred on the faculty side:</p>
<ul>
<li>After 31 years of teaching statistics at Smith, <strong>Katherine Halvorsen</strong> retired. Unfortunately, Katherine’s much-deserved retirement party was postponed due to the pandemic, but we’ll celebrate her once gatherings of more than 30 people are allowed on campus. As you might have expected given Katherine’s work ethic, she is still planning to teach two classes this academic year.</li>
<li><strong>Jenny Smetzer</strong>, <strong>Dhanamalee Bandara</strong>, and <strong>David Rockoff</strong> have left the College.</li>
<li><strong>Ben Baumer</strong> received tenure and promotion to associate professor, and has taken over as SDS chair. Ben is the first faculty member to receive tenure as a member of SDS.</li>
<li>We hired <strong>Scott LaCombe</strong> to a tenure-track position that is joint with the Government department (see below). Wish Scott well, he now has to deal with <em>two different Baumers</em> for department chairs! 😆</li>
<li><strong>Sara Stoudt ’15</strong> finished her PhD at UC-Berkeley and was hired as a Lecturer. Even though Sara technically predates the SDS program, like many of you she is living proof that we are doing something right over here.</li>

<p>I’m trying to enjoy all the time at home with my wife and two children. 🤪 Alice is 6, and she can now read, swim, ride a bike, and log in to a Linux terminal. Arlo is 3 and she is an adorable terror. Today I woke up when she jumped on my head (true story).</p>
<p>Last fall, I taught a new course on advanced programming with R, that was very rewarding for both the students and me. <a href="https://twitter.com/BaumerBen/status/1220456055353892864">They wrote 11 R packages in three weeks</a>, some of which have already built up a user base and may make it onto CRAN!</p>
<p>I’m now a <em>tenured</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/BaumerBen/status/1231314064942551040">associate professor</a>, which is strange and wonderful. I’m working on finishing a 2nd edition of our data science textbook, <em>Modern Data Science with R</em>. This one will have <a href="https://beanumber.github.io/mdsr2e/">a free online version</a>! This is been a very trying year, but I’m so encouraged by all the incredible work our alums are doing and all the fabulous colleagues I get to work with!</p>
<p>It still doesn’t feel real that <strong>Sara Stoudt ’15</strong> has finished her PhD and will be working with us (especially since no one meets in person anymore!). <a href="https://twitter.com/BaumerBen/status/1279392008881287168">Things have truly come full circle for me</a> and I couldn’t be prouder.</p>

<h4>Randi Garcia</h4>
<p>This crazy year is divided in half by COVID-19! One highlight for me from the before times is that I took five Smith students to the Women in Statistics and Data Science’s annual conference held this year in Bellevue Washington. Our flight out of Bradley was cancelled due to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2019/10/02/vintage-aircraft-crashes-at-bradley-international-airport-connecticut.cnn">plane crash</a>, so we changed our flights to Logan. We then left a wallet in the Valley Transporter van upon arrival at Logan (but got it back!) and then we left a laptop at TSA in route to our gate (but got it back later!). In the end we <a href="https://twitter.com/randiLgarcia/status/1179600080829128704">MADE it</a>! It was a joy to speak on the plenary panel, “Creating and Sustaining Respectful and Inclusive Community” and to attend my first WSDS! In the Fall semester I also taught my research seminar PSY 364: Research seminar in Intergroup Relationships for the second time, and SDS 291: Multiple Regression for the first time. It was lovely! During COVID times I’ve picked up several hobbies including gardening, cooking, meditation, reading for pleasure and personal growth, and <em>beginner</em> guitar. This year I’ve published papers in the Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology and Frontiers in Psychology’s section on Gender, Sex and Sexualities. I’ve also recently submitted a paper investigating daily instagram use and women’s self-objectification for publication in a psychology journal.</p>

<h4>Katherine Halvorsen</h4>
<p>Last fall I returned from teaching at Middlebury College in 2018–19 to teach at Smith again. September was a challenging month. I plunged back into Smith advising, committee work, and teaching Probability and Categorical Data Analysis. I became the Honors Chair for Math and Stat. I served as honors advisor to <strong>Crystal Zang ’20</strong> in SDS and as a reader for <strong>Aoi Ogawa ’20</strong>’s thesis in SDS. I visited Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, as a member of their visiting committee for the Math and Stat Department, and I continue to serve on the Board of Directors for the American Statistical Association and on the ASA’s Council of Sections Governing Board. In the beginning of the spring term my husband and I enjoyed several Smith basketball home games. After spring break and during the move to online teaching we have turned to jigsaw puzzles for amusement and long walks. My big news is that I have retired after 31 years teaching at Smith. I knew I would miss you all and thus I’ve signed up to teach part-time next year: Probability in the fall and Math Stat in the spring.</p>

<h4>Will Hopper</h4>
<p>I’m excited to start my first full year at Smith, and keep doing what I do best: introducing students to their new favorite subject, statistics! I’ll be teaching SDS 201, which introduces people to the wonderful world of statistical modeling, as well as SDS 291, which goes more into depth with Multiple Regression, and introduces people to an even wider family of statistical models. Thanks to teaching remotely, I’ve revived my video production and editing skills that have lied dormant since undergraduate film classes. Despite the circumstances, I’ve had a lot of fun making silly thumbnails and pretending I’m a YouTuber.</p>
<p>When I’m not thinking about how to explain the nuances of a two-tailed hypothesis test, I love playing competetive Pokémon, specifically the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonVGC/comments/5bmuua/so_you_want_to_play_vgc_newcomers_start_here/">VGC format</a>. I’ve been playing with <a href="https://twitter.com/ashtoncoxgaz/status/1277064810098802688">Ashton Cox’s Pincurchin/Raichu Team</a> recently, which has absolutely tanked my ranking, but it’s all in good fun. Come to office hours if you want to team-build with me!</p>

<p>What a bonkers 2019-2020 it has been! We’ll be telling our grandchildren’s generation about it for sure! This past year I taught, both in-person and remotely, SDS 220 Intro Stats twice, SDS 192 Intro to Data Science, as well as SDS’s revamped <a href="https://rudeboybert.github.io/SDS293/" target="_blank">SDS 293 Modeling for Machine Learning</a>. Some highlights of this past year:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I was honoured with the 2020 Faculty Teaching Award from the Smith College Student Government Association for outstanding dedication to teaching! Thanks Smithies!</li>
<li>In September, I accompanied <a href="https://twitter.com/SmithCollegeSDS/status/1175474705605771269" target="_blank">four Smithies</a> to StatFest 2019 at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston TX. StatFest is a one-day ASA conference aimed at encouraging undergraduate students from historically underrepresented groups to consider careers and graduate studies in the statistical sciences.</li>
<li>The print edition of my <a href="https://moderndive.com/" target="_blank"><em>Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse</em></a> textbook was published by CRC Press.</li>
<li>My first foray into forest ecology research was published by the Public Library of Science journal PLOS One: <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229930" target="_blank"><em>A permutation test and spatial cross-validation approach to assess models of interspecific competition between trees.</em></a> Try saying that title three times fast!</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly, my normal self-care routines took a big hit from the shoulder surgery I had in December as well as the pandemic. Some new outlets for well-being I’ve discovered as a result include: sensory deprivation epsom salt-water floats, TRX suspension training, spinning, going on long walks, and gardening. Although a family of deer are constantly eating all my crops 🦌🦌🦌🌿!</p>

<p>It’s almost strange to think that our last newsletter was just a year ago! My second year at Smith included teaching new courses, attending conferences, submitting research papers for review, bringing collaborators to Smith, and knitting (both Rmd files and actual yarn). A few highlights from this year, include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Journeying to International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference in the Netherlands with seven Smithies in November. They opened the main conference presenting their peer-reviewed paper and then spent the rest of the week discussing music, computer science, and video games with leading experts in the field. They were constantly mistaken for graduate students, which was really cool.</li>
<li>Co-Organizing the <a href="https://wimir.wordpress.com/2019/06/26/wimir-workshop-2019-project-guides/">Women in MIR workshop</a> (that four Smithies attended!) and attending the <a href="https://wimlworkshop.org/2019/">Women in Machine Learning workshop</a> in 2019</li>
<li>Being part of the Kahn Project <a href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/kahn-institute/translations-project">TranslationS</a> and worked on my book proposal with my collaborator <a href="http://johnlaudun.org/">Prof. John Laudun</a>. Prof. Laudun was also able to visit Smith, where we shared our work at the Liberal Arts Lunch.</li>
<li>Supervising <strong>Jessica Keast ’20</strong>’s SDS thesis. It was a great project, and it was an absolute highlight of my year to see her present her work (over Zoom) to an audience that included SDS majors, MIR experts, and faculty as well as her friends and family. Jessica also won the annual SDS Research Prize for her collection of research conducted at Smith, including her thesis and work on the ISMIR paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>There’s lots to be excited about for next year, including our amazing new SDS colleagues <strong>Will Hopper</strong>, <strong>Scott LaCombe</strong>, and <strong>Sara Stoudt ’15</strong>! Looking forward to working with all of them!</p>
</div>
<div id="scott-lacombe" class="section level4">
<h4>Scott LaCombe</h4>
<p><a href="https://scottlacombe.weebly.com/">Scott LaCombe</a> is joining Smith College this Fall with a joint appointment in Statistical and Data Sciences and Government. He received his PhD in Political Science from the University of Iowa and will be living in New England for the first time. Scott’s focus is leveraging data to better understand how public opinion is translated into state policies, and what networks states have formed when developing policy solutions. He is very excited to be teaching in the Fall and exploring the Pioneer Valley.</p>

<p>What a year! Before everything got locked down I traveled to Santiago, Chile to work with my collaborator <a href="http://www.mat.uc.cl/personas/perfil/isabelle.beaudry">Isabelle Beaudry</a>, to Irvine to work with <a href="https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/facultystaff/aliciajohnson/">Alicia Johnson</a> and Smith Alum <a href="https://mdogucu.ics.uci.edu/"><strong>Mine Dogucu ’09</strong></a> on our forthcoming textbook <em>Bayes Rules! An Introduction to Bayesian Modeling with R</em>, and to Harvard and the Icahn School of Medicine to talk about my research in respondent driven sampling. This year I taught Intro Stats in the fall, and for the first time I taught the SDS Capstone course in the spring. My first SDS major advisees graduated, and I am so proud of all of them! I joined the development committee of the American Statistical Association, and am excited to learn more about the ASA as an organization. I am delighted to be working with new SDS colleagues <strong>Will Hopper</strong>, <strong>Scott LaCombe</strong>, and <strong>Sara Stoudt ’15</strong>! Special message to alums: I love hearing/reading your updates!</p>

I’m looking forward to teaching Communicating with Data and intro stats (and being back in Herrell’s territory).</p>
<p>Since the last newsletter I had an amazing summer at the LA Times, I wrote my dissertation (“A Statistical Investigation of Species Distribution Models and Communication of Statistics Across Disciplines”), Deb Nolan and I submitted our “Communicating with Data” book, and I picked up <a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/04/kidz-bop/">some other</a> <a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/06/karen/">fun projects</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08708.pdf">along the way</a>.</p>
